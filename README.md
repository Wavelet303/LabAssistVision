# LabVision
Proof of concept of a mixed reality application for the Microsoft HoloLens 2 integrating object recognition using cloud computing and real-time on-device markerless object tracking using MRTK. The augmented objects provide interaction using hand input, eye-gaze, and voice commands to visually verify the tracking result while maintaining a high frame rate of the application.
